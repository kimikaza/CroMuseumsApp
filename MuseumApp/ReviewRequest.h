// -shouldAskForReview:. The former is suggested as it will make sure the user
// has launched the app several times first. The iTunes URL must be specified
// as this is what will be opened in iTunes. All other properties can be
// overridden and the string properties should be overridden for localization.
// See the following links for information about generating your iTunes URL.
